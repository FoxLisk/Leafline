### an oppositional strategy game engine

Leafline is a oppositional stategy game for two teams! It takes place by moving figurines on an 8 by 8 grid. The two teams are called Blue and Orange, and each team starts with the following set of figurines:

* eight *servants* (move one square towards the opposing team's side, can stun opposing figurines diagonally and towards the opposing team's side)
* two *ponies* (hop to a locale one square in one direction and two squares orthogonally)
* two *scholars* (move diagonally while unobstructed)
* two *cops* (move with the grid of the world)
* one *princess* (can move like a scholar or a cop)
* one *figurehead* (can move to any of the eight adjacent locales)

The goal is to stun the opposing team's figurehead!
