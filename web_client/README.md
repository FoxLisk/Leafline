# Leafline web client

Web client for the Leafline oppositional strategy game engine!

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

```
lein run
```

Alternatively, you can say `lein repl` to get a REPL and then run `(restart-server!)` to start the server (or restart it if it is already running).
